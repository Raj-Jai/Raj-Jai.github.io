           Kailasa Temple,Maharashtra</h2>
        <img class="image" src="images/kailasa.jpg">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Formed from a single block of excavated stone, Kailasa temple is considered one of the most impressive cave temples in India. The enormous structure is one of 34 cave temples and monasteries that are collectively known as the Ellora Caves. Located in the western region of Maharashtra, the caves are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and include monuments dating between 600 and 1000 CE. While there are many impressive structures on-site, it's the megalithic Kailasa temple that is perhaps the most well known.<br><br>Enormous stone carvings depict different Hindu deities with particular attention to Shiva. As one walks past the gopuram, panels on the left have followers of Shiva, while panels on the left show devotees of Vishnu.  At the base of the temple, a herd of carved elements appears to carry the load of the temple on their backs. It's thanks to these masterful sculptures, as well as the incredible engineering of the temple, that Kailasa is considered an outstanding example of Indian art and architecture.<br><br>

            Konark Sun Temple, Orissa</h2>
        <img class="image" src="images/konark.jpg">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
Dedicated to Sun God, Konark Sun Temple was built by King Narasimhadeva I of Eastern Ganga dynasty in the 13th century CE to commemorate his victory over Muslims invaders. European sailors used this temple tower for navigation, but dubbed it the Black Pagoda for the frequent shipwrecks that occurred along the coast. This temple is one of the grandest temples of India and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1984. Konark was sacked by the Muslim Yavana army in the 15th century. The central statue enshrined in the temple was smuggled away to Puri by priests, but the Sun Temple was badly damaged in the attack. In the late 19th century, the remnants of this temple were excavated.

            Sanchi Stupa, Madhya Pradesh</h2>
        <img class="image" src="images/sanchi.jpeg">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Great Stupa at Sanchi has been the focal point of the Buddhist faith in the region since it was built by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC. The grand structure still inspires awe today and sits at the top of a hill, surrounded by the remains of smaller stupas, monasteries, and temples that were built as the religious community grew in the centuries after the site was founded.

Despite its impressive scale today, the original Ashokan stupa was about half the size and built from large bricks and mud mortar. It’s believed it had raised terraces at the base, was enclosed by a wooden railing, and was crowned by a stone umbrella. The stupa was enlarged using local sandstone during the Sunga period, which began about 50 years after Ashoka’s death. The elaborately-carved gateways were added later, in the 1st century BC.<br><br>

            <b>Best time to visit –</b> November to March during the winters
<br><br>

            <b> How to reach:</b> The Raja Bhoj Airport in Gandhi Nagar, Bhopal, is the closest airport to the Sanchi Stupa, about 55 kilometres away. From the airport you can hire a taxi that will bring you to the heritage site in under an hour and a half.<br><br>
